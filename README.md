# MappedOut | Voice-Driven-Mind-Mapping with AI

🚀 Introduction

In today's fast-paced world, ideas often come and go faster than we can capture them. Whether you're brainstorming, journaling, or taking class notes, the process of organizing your thoughts shouldn't slow you down. That's why we built MappedOut — a voice-powered web application that instantly transcribes speech and converts it into an interactive mind map, helping users visually structure their ideas with the power of AI.

Our project was developed during a hackathon with the goal of streamlining ideation, note-taking, and personal expression. We wanted to make it easier for users to externalize and organize their thoughts by simply speaking, without the burden of typing or structuring. Powered by OpenAI Whisper, Neo4j, and an intuitive React frontend, OutOfYourMind offers a seamless, intelligent, and creative experience.
